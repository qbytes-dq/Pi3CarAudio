# Pi3CarAudio
# Raspberry Pi Car audio

This project is for users to build a Raspberry Pi car radio written with 100% Python. 

Components included are:
- FM Radio
- Voltage Monitor
- MP3 Player
- Video Player
- OBDII (OBD2)
- GPS for NAVIT
- VNC (Mirror phone for GPS)
- Backup Camera
- Forward Camera
- etc...

Not sure GPS and NAVIT are the best choice, I'm not able to find my home address or street (live here 10 years).  In addition, it does not take current traffic patterns into consideration.

Most of the sample projects I've come across use RPi2 and modify the OS.  I know it is named Pi3, that is because I only own a RPi3, the script should work on all RPi.  This will be 100% script driven to enable multiple environments.

TAGs will be created upon functionality being available, not every commit.
